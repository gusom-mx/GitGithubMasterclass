<!--  Setting up GitHub locally and moving files from the hard disk to the Git repository-->

<!--/////////////////////////////////-->

<!-- To initialize a Git repository in your computer you go into the the directory where the files are
hosted using the terminal. Once you are there you need to type

git init

This will create an empty Git repository (master #) but the repository will be empty, the # states that there is an empty
repository. What we need to do is to copy it from our working directory into the Git repository. To do so we need to type:

git add index.html

But the above has added in staged state. We need to commit the file to the Git repository. To do so we type

git commit -m "Add index.html to repository"
-->

<!---To find the difference between the different version of a file in Git we need to type

git diff index.html

-->

<!--- to understand the status of you git type:

git status
-->

<!-- 
Git displays different symbols which mean different things

# - This means that there are new files

+ - New items have been staged

* - This means that there are changes available on a file that is already available in the Git repository has been
    changed.
-->

<!--- Every commit includes a shas number. Initially that number can be used to compare the current changes with 
    an existing commit. The way to do that is as follows:

    git diff shas_number -p

<!---- Pushing files to GitHub      -->

<!--/////////////////////////////////-->

<!---

 To push the local into GitHUb you need to have the URL for yout GitHb account and also you need to have a GutHub
 token to use as a password and then type:

 git remote add origin URL

 git push origin master

 Now, there is a shortcut so you do not have to add every file every time. You can use th following to automatically
 add and commit the file(s).

 git commit -a -m "add your message for the commit."

-->

<!---
If changes are being added or made directly in GitHub we need to ensure that those changes are also in our local machine.
the way to do this is by typing:

git pull [remote from where you are pulling] [name of branch]

git pull origin master

-->

<!---
There is a way to put in place a tracker or sniffer to check GitHub or remote branch for changes.
The aim is to reduce the instructions we need to type in order to synchronise GitHub/remote branch with our local.

git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master master
                                ^            ^
                This is the path to GitHub   This is the branch we are tracking in GitHub.

The final instructions would be:

git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master master

The instruction above only needs to be done once.

After that to pull the from GitHub(remote) to the local you just need to type:

git pull

-->

<!--    git status

    We have used this before to understand the staus in relation to our local enviroenment. This git status command will
    tell us if have changed any of the files and whether they need to be push to the remote GitHub repository.

    But what about the opposite. That is when updates have been implemented in GitHub and we haven't got them in our 
    environment as yet. How do we do that, how do we get that status? First we download the files that have been 
    changed but we do not merge them with our local. To do so we use:

    git fetch

    The above will give us an overview of what has been updated, number of files etc. Remember, this is just a download
    not a merger to the local. The next step is to merger the download files. To do so we use:

    git pull

<!---- GitHub and forking      -->

<!--/////////////////////////////////-->

<!--
Forking is when you make yuor own copy from someone else's repository. Up to the time of the forking taking place the
original and the copy are the same. After that the copies 'fork' and your changes/additions in your fork do not 
update in the orginal repository and viseversa.

The forking and copying of the selected reporsitory take place within your GitHub account. That is quite simple to do,
you just find the repository you can to copy and the press the fork button in GitHub. That is just the first par of 
the process.

The second part part is to CLONE that Github copy into you local Git repository so you can work on it locally. First step
is to generate a new directory, probably under Documents, called [repos]. In that add a new directory with the name of
the repository you have forked. Once in that directory you need to type

git clone URL <---- the URL is the URL of the forked copy (found under code)

The above should create the local copy.
-->

<!--/////////////////////////////////-->

<!---- Ggit log and git show  and git show HEAD~x   -->

<!--/////////////////////////////////-->
<!--

To see all the changes/commits in a clone you can type

git log

We can also check the difference between different commits using the shas number. We can access the shas number by using
the git log instruction. To compare two different commits using the shas number we have to type

git diff [shas number first 8 digits] [shas number first 8 digits]

git diff 33604c33 20ff3c0a

If you want to see more detail when viewing a commit when using the shas, the you can use [show]

gif show [shas number first 8 digits]
git show 33604c33


The last commit includes a [HEAD] which identifies that commit as the last one. Using that [HEAD] one access that last 
change as:

git show HEAD

But you can also use the [HEAD] and subtraction to access the 2nd commit before the last as such:

git show HEAD~2

You can also use head to compare amongst two commits such as:

git show HEAD~2 HEAD~5

<!---- git annotate   -->

<!--/////////////////////////////////-->

<!--

With annotate we can find out the entire history for one single file. The way to do it is:

git annotate [file name]

git annotate index.html
