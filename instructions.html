<!-- To initialize a Git repository in your computer you go into the the directory where the files are
hosted using the terminal. Once you are there you need to type

git init

This will create an empty Git repository (master #) but the repository will be empty, the # states that there is an empty
repository. What we need to do is to copy it from our working directory into the Git repository. To do so we need to type:

git add index.html

But the above has added in staged state. We need to commit the file to the Git repository. To do so we type

git commit -m "Add index.html to repository"
-->

<!---To find the difference between the different version of a file in Git we need to type

git diff index.html

-->

<!--- to understand the status of you git type:

git status
-->

<!-- 
Git displays different symbols which mean different things

# - This means that there are new files

+ - New items have been staged

* - This means that there are changes available on a file that is already available in the Git repository has been
    changed.
-->

<!--- Every commit includes a shas number. Initially that number can be used to compare the current changes with 
    an existing commit. The way to do that is as follows:

    git diff shas_number -p


-->

<!---

 To push the local into GitHUb you need to have the URL for yout GitHb account and also you need to have a GutHub
 token to use as a password and then type:

 git remote add origin URL

 git push origin master


-->

<!---
If changes are being added or made directly in GitHub we need to ensure that those changes are also in our local machine.
the way to do this is by typing:

git pull [remote from where you are pulling] [name of branch]

git pull origin master

-->

<!---
There is a way to put in place a tracker or sniffer to check GitHub or remote branch for changes.
The aim is to reduce the instructions we need to type in order to synchronise GitHub/remote branch with our local.

git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master master
                                ^            ^
                This is the path to GitHub   This is the branch we are tracking in GitHub.

The final instructions would be:

git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master master

The instruction above only needs to be done once.

After that to pull the from GitHub(remote) to the local you just need to type:

git pull

-->

<!--    git status

    We have used this before to understand the staus in relation to our local enviroenment. This git status command will
    tell us if have changed any of the files and whether they need to be push to the remote GitHub repository.

    But what about the opposite. That is when updates have been implemented in GitHub and we haven't got them in our 
    environment as yet. How do we do that, how do we get that status? First we download the files that have been 
    changed but we do not merge them with our local. To do so we use:

    git fetch

    The above will give us an overview of what has been updated, number of files etc. Remember, this is just a download
    not a merger to the local. The next step is to merger the download files. To do so we use:

    git pull
