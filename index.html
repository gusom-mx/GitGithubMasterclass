<h1>Hello Git World!</h1>

<!-- To initialize a Git repository in your computer you go into the the directory where the files are
hosted using the terminal. Once you are there you need to type

git init

This will create an empty Git repository (master #) but the repository will be empty, the # states that there is an empty
repository. What we need to do is to copy it from our working directory into the Git repository. To do so we need to type:

git add index.html

But the above has added in staged state. We need to commit the file to the Git repository. To do so we type

git commit -m "Add index.html to repository"
-->

<div>
    <p>This are some changes to see how Git keeps track of versions</p>
</div>

<!---To find the difference between the different version of a file in Git we need to type

git diff index.html
